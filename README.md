# sort_timer

For this project, I imported the *time* and *random* modules. I also installed the *matplotlib* package and imported from it the *pyplot* module.

The sort_timer function times how many seconds it takes the decorated function to run. The decorator's wrapper function returns the elapsed time.

The function **compare_sorts** takes the two decorated sort functions as parameters and generates a graph comparing their sort times.
